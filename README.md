# Estimation of Phase Function based on Machine Learning

Summer intern project supervised by Prof. [Ge Wang](https://biotech.rpi.edu/centers/bic/people/faculty/ge-wang), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI).

Started from May, 2021.

The repo **phasefunction** hosts my code for the summer intern project aimed at estimating the phase function of light propagation in a medium directly from the transmittance images. The feasibility of data-driven deep learning approach is explored. I started coding in MATLAB to generate the simulation data and a first model, and then moved to Python and Pytroch. All versions of the code, whether perfect or not, are saved here to record my learning trajectory. I will clean up the code and put them into a new repo when the final report is done.
 
This repo hosts the codes on Xubuntu 18.04.

**Note**: Install _MathJax Plugin for Github_ from Chrome Store to show the mathematical equations correctly.
